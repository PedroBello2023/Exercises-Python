# Exercises-Python
 Python exercises/challenges from the Python course taught by professor Gustavo Guanabara - Video Course. In this course I learned the basics of the Python language, including modules and error handling.

 ## Final Project:
 Below are some images of the final project done in this basic python video course. In this project we created a data reader that registers data and organizes it in a table in an organized manner. The difference in this project is that you can always register a new user and this will be part of the database and will be removed at the next show of registered users. If you enter any wrong data, it warns you but does not interrupt the program. Notice that after printing the data I made a new registration and it printed with the new user.
