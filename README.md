# Exercises-Python
 Python exercises/challenges from the Python course taught by professor Gustavo Guanabara - Video Course. In this course I learned the basics of the Python language, including modules and error handling.

 ## Final Project:
 Below are some images of the final project done in this basic python video course. In this project we created a data reader that registers data and organizes it in a table in an organized manner. The difference in this project is that you can always register a new user and this will be part of the database and will be removed at the next show of registered users.
